### Like
-	I like the use of Spotify API, as it’s a mostly free and widely used music platform that smaller artists can access.
-	I like the variety of typography samples in the visual design study, I feel like they represent a variety of styles while remaining unified in their rounded elements.
### Wish
-	I saw there was a “My Playlists” button at the top of the UI sketches so to further the direct social connection, I wish each playlist had an array of owners instead of just one assigned owner so friends could create a playlist together.
-	I wish there was a feature to add a song to my friend’s “Listen to Later” playlist. The song could be tagged to indicate I added it. In this same vein of thought, I would love more features that add direct social connection through the medium of music instead of interactions like Letterboxed, where you just interact with a user’s static review. 
### Wonder
-	Is there a way to filter when I am searching for songs? As a user I would like to be able to search for the best rated Pop or Country songs.
-	I saw in the Design Summary that Noted will handle harmful language in reviews, my mind immediately went to how sites like Instagram crowd source regulation through reporting however this could lead to users simply reporting reviews they don’t agree with instead of reviews that use inappropriate language, so I am interested in seeing how Noted handles this.
