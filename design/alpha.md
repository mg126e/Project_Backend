# Checkpoint: Alpha

Our frontend code is stored [here](https://github.com/mg126e/Project_Frontend). The deployed version using Render is here (TODO: add link).

## Screen Recording

## Updated Development Plan


TODO: update development plan 

We will aim for a timeline similar to the individual projects where we first created our backend, then our frontend, and then introduced syncs. This will ensure we are working incrementally and thoroughly. The table below provides more detailed information for each stage.  

| Stage | Features | Responsibilities | Key Risks |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| November 25th, Checkpoint: Alpha | Password authentication <br> User profile <br> One-time matching <br> Messaging | Gloria: User profile, password authentication  <br> Ananya: One-time matching <br>Marin: Messaging <br>ALL: collaborate to connect our concepts to our frontend | If we find that we are having difficulties with the real-time runner matching, as a fallback, we may decide to combine the one-time matching feature with the long-term matching. This would mean making it so that once a user goes on a run through the one-time matching, the long-term aspect would kick in immediately after they complete their run by asking if they want to be long-term partners. |
| December 2nd, Checkpoint: Beta | EmailVerification <br> Long-term matching <br> Shared goals <br> Milestone map  | Gloria: SharedGoals <br>Ananya: Long-term matching, email verification <br>Marin: Milestone map<br>ALL: collaborate to connect our concepts to our frontend | A potential key risk would be incorporating LLM generation of potential steps for the running partners to work towards their goals as the steps may be irrelevant to how the users envisioned reaching their goals. We will mitigate this risk by working on perfecting our prompt and testing out step generation. As a fallback, we will allow users to manually create their own steps for their shared goals. Another key risk would be perfecting the long-term matching but as mentioned in the row above, we will be sure to deeply evaluate what structure of the matching features ends up working best and look into how preference thresholds are designed to match two people. |
| December 9th, Full Demo | Based on user testing, we will refine our features based on the feedback we receive. We will also include our syncs. We will also deploy using Render. | ALL: work on syncs & complete extensive testing on our backend and frontend | A potential risk could be from the feedback we get during user testing. For instance, if users find that an additional feature would be best to include but would be impossible to implement under the time frame, we will evaluate how aspects of the feature could be included within our existing concepts. Additionally, since we now have experience incorporating syncs, we do not expect there to be as many issues here but we plan to ask questions on Piazza or to our TA mentor if huge issues arise that we would need another perspective on. |
