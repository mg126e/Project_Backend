# I like...
This is a topic I’ve thought about before so I’m glad to see a group is addressing this problem! I appreciate that it combines aspects from various apps, including Spotify, iTunes, and Instagram. Another comparable that’s on the same level would be GoodReads! I also liked the visual design study. I think it gives your app a clear visual identity and separates it from other music-related apps I have seen. 

# I wish...
I am a bit concerned about the overlap with Spotify since many of the features exist in Spotify, and your team is using the Spotify API. I also wonder about the name being different in some way since I first assumed this was going to be a notes app! I am curious about how you could lean into your app name even more, though, by having a feature where users could create private notes to reflect on the music, which I think also addresses part of the problem statement of wanting a central place for everything. 

# I wonder...
I am wondering if, in your user profile, you could allow for even more personalization by letting users add some form of tags. The tags could be their favorite genres or other small filterable facts. Users could then use those tags to filter and send friend requests to those with common interests. Your team could also potentially even introduce leaderboards based on who has listened to or written the most reviews about a particular genre. This app also partially reminds me of the website Genius in regard to finding community over songs. It would be a cool feature if, as part of the review process, users could highlight lyrics and explain why they resonated with them.
