# I like...
I like that the project is built around a clear and relatable problem: discovering music and logging these finds in unique ways are scattered across different apps. The idea of allowing users to rate songs and note down impressions would support the personal connection that people feel with their music taste, while also letting them observe progressions in their preferences over time in a consolidated way. I also like how the app incorporates social elements by letting friends discuss each other's songs and comment on each other's reviews. In my opinion, this can create ongoing conversations about a lot of underappreciated music while also helping people create social connections through shared taste.

# I wish...
It feels like there is a potential conflict between balancing personal music journaling and social connection based on music. While the social aspects, like commenting on reviews and seeing other people's ratings, are probably great for discovery, I think some users might also want a more private, reflective space to track just their music preferences. I wish there was an opt-out choice in the feed feature for users who want to log their own opinions but don't want to know other people's thoughts on a song. There could be a privacy toggle when posting that would allow you to 'post' a review of a song just as a memory for yourself, as opposed to actually post one for your connections to interact with.

# I wonder...
I wonder how the app will handle the evolving nature of music tastes over time in a way that a user's listening history is actually accessible to them. Like the problem framing assignment mentions, people's music preferences change so often based on mood, trends, or personal experiences. It would be interesting to show a user their own 'taste profile' as trendlines and patterns across all their interactions rather than just a collection of their past reviews. For example, telling a user 'You added a recommended song to Favourites 5x more when it was Jazz in 2024 but 3x more when it was Alt rock this year' rather than only showing them all their reviews as a long Twitter-esque timeline.
