# **Problem Framing**

## **Domain**

* **Running:** Running is one of the most popular and relatively accessible forms of exercise, but many people struggle to stay motivated or consistent with it. It offers physical benefits like improved cardiovascular health and stamina, and mental benefits like stress relief. Many people run for fitness, recreation, or competition, and running communities can play a big role in shaping people’s experiences with the activity.

## **Problem**

* **Building Safe Communities for Running:** Beginners, students just starting their college journey, runners returning after a break, and even seasoned athletes looking for a training partner often struggle to find others who match their pace, schedule, and goals; especially since word-of-mouth is usually the only method of discovery. This lack of accessible connection not only limits motivation and consistency but also raises important safety concerns. Many runners prefer not to run alone, particularly in unfamiliar areas, at night, or on long routes where visibility and foot traffic are low. Without a reliable way to find trusted, compatible running partners or groups, runners may face increased risks related to safety and navigating unsafe routes. An app that helps people connect with runners who have similar goals and plan safer running experiences would be helpful to create a more positive running journey, particularly for beginner and amateur runners.


## **Evidence**

* [Having running partners adds a level of accountability that is difficult to achieve otherwise](https://zapendurance.com/group-running-vs-running-alone/#:~:text=Joining%20a%20local%20running%20group,taxing%20both%20physically%20and%20mentally.): This article argues that running with others can boost accountability, reduce perceived effort on harder days, and elevate motivation and performance, though the writer does advise that it could be balanced with solo runs that can offer a valuable space for reflection.  
* [Social networks play an important role in maintaining a consistent training habit](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8966768/): A study concluded that runners who increased the number of key running partners they ran with tended to train more frequently and were more likely to accomplish their set goals regardless of whether they were socially motivated to run.  
* [Members of the running group had positive social interaction and support during and outside running](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337690074_Running_together_is_better_than_running_alone_a_qualitative_study_of_a_self-organised_distance_running_group_in_China): A study on a self-organised running group reported that members found improvements in their running, physical/mental health, personality, and attitude towards life after joining, which demonstrates the benefits of not running alone.  
* [Affective feelings are directly influenced by the presence of opponents](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32050163/): A 2020 study found that participants running in competition in a head to head 10 km race felt and performed better than their counterparts running alone.  
* [How can moving together make us feel closer and more connected?](https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/article/why-exercising-friends-could-be-better-you): This Oxford article argues that working out with friends lessens fatigue and increases enjoyment and that this heightened positive effect can lead to better performance.  
* [Reasons to Find a Running Buddy](https://campusrec.wfu.edu/2021/03/reasons-to-find-a-running-buddy/#:~:text=While%20similar%20to%20accountability%2C%20having,partner%20span%20across%20many%20dimensions.): Wake Forest University published an article stating that running partners increase improvement, motivation, and safety.  
* [Many women fear for their safety when running alone. Here’s how they prepare](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/06/health/women-runners-safety-tips-wellness-cec): CNN Health reports that 92% of women surveyed feel concerned for their safety when they go for a run and share the many things they do to feel more safe while running, including running with another person.  
* [ASICS Move Every Mind Study](https://cms-static.asics.com/media-libraries/104783/file.pdf?_gl=1*1n66kcq*_gcl_au*NDU5NDQ4NzA5LjE3NjMxNjc4MTU.*_ga*MTA2MjIyNTU1My4xNzYzMTY3ODE2*_ga_YGVM1D8ER1*czE3NjMxNjc4MTUkbzEkZzEkdDE3NjMxNjc4NDgkajI3JGwwJGgzMTE4MzExOTY.): ASICS surveyed women from more than forty countries on the barriers stopping women from exercising and reported that “43% of women said a lack of safe spaces was putting them off from exercising” and that the most common motivator for exercise was friends.   
* [Running While Female:](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a18848270/running-while-female/) An article states that 43% of women at least sometimes experience harassment on the run compared with just 4% of men. The writer also highlights many women' s personal stories to emphasize the catcalling, following, and inappropriate comments they face, which forces them to constantly adjust their behavior to feel safe.  
* [The Role of Peer Relationships in Adjustment to College](https://wellness.asu.edu/sites/g/files/litvpz796/files/pdf_0/The%20Role%20of%20Peer%20Relationships%20in%20Adjustment%20to%20College.pdf): This study takes a look at how “there are more benefits to having a close relationship with a new college friend” than solely sticking to high school friends for first-year college students as it can improve their chances of success in college. Though our app is not directly focused on friendship, it is another potential benefit that comes from having an app that can promote a close connection focused on a shared interest in a time where many of our users may be going through the college transition. 

## **Comparables**

* [**Strava**](https://www.strava.com/): Strava is a popular app for runners, its “Community-Powered Motivation” helps many stay engaged. However, it primarily attracts experienced runners and looks less beginner friendly, especially after they appeared to recently change around their training plan feature. While it helps users find new routes, it does not have as much of a focus on matching users with running partners, which limits its usefulness for those seeking social connections on a closer level.  
* [**Nike Run Club**](https://www.nike.com/nrc-app): Nike Run Club offers guided runs, tracking, and a social feed but it appears that its social features are mostly for sharing achievements rather than matching users with partners. The developers of Nike Run Club have also changed the application's name twice before, which indicates the app may still have an unclear identity and could change again, especially since starting out as Nike+ GPS indicates something different about what the app was intended to be.  
* [**MyFitnessPal**](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/): MyFitnessPal offers tracking for various fitness activities, including running. It tackles the problem of tracking running and other fitness related activities but apart from sharing general encouragement and sharing progress in the social features it does have, it does not look at opportunities where users could do and bond over those activities together.  
* [**Facebook Groups**](https://www.facebook.com/): Many local running groups use Facebook’s Groups feature to organize events and connect members. While this can be effective, it does not offer more specific matching, such as filtering groups by pace, location, or goals, which makes it not specific enough for what runners may be looking for and also not geared toward duos.  
* [**Meetup**](https://www.meetup.com/): This application allows users to find and join different groups, including local running groups, but also, like Facebook Groups, is not designed with duos in mind. It is useful for discovering events, but these events appear to be for longer runs, such as 5 miles, which beginners would not necessarily want to participate in and are also planned farther out in advance. Our app would also emphasize spontaneity when it comes to making plans for running and allows for more personalization for the runs they want to go on.  
* [**Couch to 5k**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.c25k&hl=en_US): This application is designed to help beginners start running with a specific goal in mind but it assumes users want to always train for a race and may add pressure, especially if a user may need to slow down their journey. It also does not focus on building social connections, making running seem like an activity to do alone.  
* [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/): The Running subreddit specifically on Reddit provides advice, support, and a community for runners, but is not location based and does not specifically facilitate in-person connections. Similar to Facebook Groups and Meetup, Reddit has so many groups/subreddits that it does not appear to offer specific filtering through messages and for finding more specialized subreddits.  
* [**RunHub**](https://www.runhub.co/): RunHub acts as a directory for running clubs and events, which makes it useful for finding formal clubs but does not support the formation of informal running partners, which can be seen with its application that requires extensive information before one can submit their club. They tackle the problem of human connection when running, but it may seem daunting and not the right fit for beginners who are looking for a closer connection.  
* [**WalkBud.**](https://walkbud.org/) This app tackles a similar problem related to safety by having a personal person to walk with, but is focused on nighttime situations and treats walking only as part of a transactional matter. Our application would emphasize the possibilities of connection when running with another person alongside the safety benefits. 

## **Features**

* **Real-time Run Buddy:** Similar to Uber in which a user looks for drivers, a user can search for other users who are currently on a run within a certain radius around their ‘pick-up’ location or chosen starting point. Other runners receive this request and can choose to accept the partner run and meet them at the pick-up point.  
* **Partner Matching:** This feature would mean matching users looking for a person to regularly go on runs with (to cultivate a long-standing relationship) by generating matches based on running experience level, pace and distance preferences, location, gender, and other filtering tags. Whether they continue to keep running together or run once, it encourages human connection and helps users stay active through running. It also indirectly benefits another stakeholder, grocery stores and athletic businesses, who would benefit from runners purchasing supplies and even customized duo merchandise for themselves.  
* **Shared Goals:** This feature would mean that once users who have been matched agree to continue seeing each other after their first run, they can opt in to create shared goals that they will work toward together, such as reaching 100 miles or running in various types of environments. This encourages them to continue working together with more concrete milestones to look forward to and push themselves physically.  
* **Milestone Map:** A private shared map between two running partners where they can drop a pin at a location where they met a milestone and upload a picture if they want. For example, they could upload a selfie of the two at a Point A where they completed their first 5K.  
* **Safety Measures.** Since we know that applications such as Facebook Groups or dating apps that can facilitate in-person meetings can carry risks, we have thought about different safety measures. As part of the registration process, a user, which would be a college student, must upload their student ID as part of our verification process. This ensures a level of security for users. 

## **Ethical Analysis**

**Insight 1: Adapting to Runners’ Changing Goals (Prompt: Time \- Adaptation) 
a) Observation:** Runners’ motivations can evolve over time. A user might start out as a beginner looking to explore casual 5Ks and gradually transition to intensive marathon training. If the app doesn’t cater to this range of potential use cases, it risks losing relevance in the user’s life and stops benefiting them. 
**b) Design response:** Create modifiable profile settings that users can change based on what stage they are at in their running journey, allowing them to automatically filter out potential run partners.

**Insight 2: Supporting Local Businesses and Communities (Prompt: Stakeholders \- Indirect Stakeholders) 
a) Observation:** Local businesses and neighbourhoods are indirectly impacted by runners using their spaces. Without an understanding, a larger number of people running through the area might cause discontentment or missed opportunities for mutually beneficial collaborations. **b) Design response:** Add a feature that recommends verified local partners in the area to runners. This gives places like coffee shops and gear stores a chance to make profits, while giving runners convenient places to purchase desired products, and creates a reciprocal relationship that could help communities view the app as a positive local force.

**Insight 3: Preventing Stalking and Unsafe Meet-ups (Prompt: Stakeholders \- Non-targeted Use) 
a) Observation:** A running-partner app could be misused for stalking, persistent, unwanted contact, or monitoring someone's patterns. People with bad intentions could try to match with runners repeatedly, use location features to track users, or create fake profiles to pose as safe run buddies. Even well-meaning but inappropriate use, like using the app to find romantic partners instead of running partners, could compromise safety and trust. 

 **b) Design response:** We currently plan to limit the app to university students where students can login with a university ID only and be able to match with other people from their university. This greatly reduces the possibility of harmful incidents, considering that it is a much more limited population.

**Insight 4: Building Long-Term Friendships (Prompt: Time \- Sustained Friendships) 
a) Observation:** Over time, an app that matches runners based on preferences can naturally help cultivate long-term friendships. When two users consistently enjoy running together, their meetups can become a valued weekly routine. Many runners may even prefer forming ongoing partnerships through the app, building steady motivation, trust, and shared progress.

 **b) Design response:** The Partner Matching feature allows people to also seek regular partners based on preferences, as opposed to one-off running partners from a pool of people who are available at that time.

**Insight 5: Supporting Health and Relaxation (Prompt: Time \- Long-Term Health and Well-Being) 
a) Observation:** We anticipate that most users of the app see running as a hobby, which is generally a source of relaxation. Running with a partner could foster a sense of competitiveness that, while healthy to an extent, may devolve into pressure instead of enjoyment. 
**b) Design response:** The app could have integrated rest-day notifications that periodically remind the user to take a break and give their body enough time to recover, especially from more strenuous runs.

**Insight 6: Protecting Users’ Trust and Privacy (Prompt: Values \- Trust and Privacy) a) Observations:** The app regularly collects sensitive data about the users like their location, interests, and social activity. It’s important to maintain a degree of transparency with the user to assuage concerns about privacy. **b) Design response:** Include easily navigable privacy settings that let users control the visibility of their information like running stats and location.
