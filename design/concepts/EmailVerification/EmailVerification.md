**EmailVerification**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that only users with a valid Boston-area college .edu email address can complete registration and access the app.
   - **Principle:** When a user registers, a verification code is sent to their email. The user must enter the correct code to activate their account.
   - **State:**
       - A set of `EmailVerifications`, each with:
           - `user`: User (reference)
           - `email`: String
           - `verificationCode`: String (randomly generated)
           - `isVerified`: Boolean
           - `codeSentAt`: DateTime
   - **Actions:**
       - `register(user: User, email: String): ()`
           - *Requires:* The user exists in PasswordAuthentication. The email domain is a valid Boston-area .edu domain. No active verification exists for this user.
           - *Effects:* Generates a verification code, sends it to the user's email, and stores the code and timestamp.
       - `verifyCode(user: User, code: String): ({ success: Boolean, error?: String })`
           - *Requires:* A verification code was sent to the user and not expired. The code matches the stored code.
           - *Effects:* Sets `isVerified` to true if the code matches. Returns success or error.
       - `resendCode(user: User): ()`
           - *Requires:* The user has a pending verification and is not yet verified.
           - *Effects:* Generates and sends a new code, updates the stored code and timestamp.
   - **Queries:**
       - `_isEmailVerified(user: User): Boolean`
           - *Effects:* Returns true if the user's email is verified.
       - `_getVerificationStatus(user: User): { email: String, isVerified: Boolean, codeSentAt: DateTime }?`
           - *Effects:* Returns the current verification status for the user, or null if none exists.
   - **Notes:**
       - When `register` is called in PasswordAuthentication, it also triggers `register` in EmailVerification to send the verification email.
       - The user cannot become active or log in until their email is verified.
