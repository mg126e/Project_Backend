**PasswordAuthentication**
   - **Purpose:** Associate usernames and passwords with user identities for authentication, limiting access to known users.
   - **Principle:** If a user registers with a unique username and password, they can subsequently authenticate with those credentials and will consistently be treated as the same user.
       - **State:**
           - A set of `Users`, each with:
               - `username`: String
               - `passwordHash`: String (hashed using SHA-256)
       - **Actions:**
           - `register(username: String, password: String): ({ user: User } | { error: String })`
               - *Requires:* No User with the given username already exists.
               - *Effects:* Creates a new User, stores a hash of the password, and returns the new user's ID. On failure, returns an error.
           - `authenticate(username: String, password: String): ({ user: User } | { error: String })`
               - *Requires:* A User with the given username exists AND the hash of the password matches the stored passwordHash.
               - *Effects:* Returns the identifier of the authenticated User. On failure, returns an error.
           - `deleteUser(user: User): ({} | { error: String })`
               - *Requires:* A User with the given user ID exists.
               - *Effects:* Permanently deletes the User and their stored credentials. On failure, returns an error.
    - **Notes:**
       - deleteUser and closeProfile will work in a sync together
