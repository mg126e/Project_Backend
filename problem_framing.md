Problem Framing

## Domain
  * **Running**. Running is a popular activity that many users may find difficult to get into. Running helps people improve their mental wellbeing and physical health.  
## Problem
  * **Finding a running partner:** Running is an accessible and healthy sport. However, the mental barrier of entry for running includes fatigue, low motivation, and safety concerns.    
## Evidence
  * [Having running partners adds a level of accountability that is difficult to achieve otherwise](https://zapendurance.com/group-running-vs-running-alone/#:~:text=Joining%20a%20local%20running%20group,taxing%20both%20physically%20and%20mentally.): This article argues that running with a group can boost accountability, reduce perceived effort on harder days, and elevate motivation and performance, however the writer advises that it should be balanced with solo runs that can offer a valuable space for reflection.  
  * [Social networks play an important role in maintaining a consistent training habit](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8966768/): A study concluded that runners who increased the number of key running partners they ran with tended to train more frequently and were more likely to accomplish their set goals regardless of whether they were socially motivated to run.  
  *  [Members of the running group had positive social interaction and support during and outside running](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337690074_Running_together_is_better_than_running_alone_a_qualitative_study_of_a_self-organised_distance_running_group_in_China):  A study on a self-organised running group reported that members found improvements in their running, physical/mental health, personality, and attitude towards life after joining the group.  
  * [Affective feelings are directly influenced by the presence of opponents](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32050163/): A 2020 study found that runners in a head to head 10 km race felt and performed better than their counterparts running alone.  
  * [How can moving together make us feel closer and more connected?](https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/article/why-exercising-friends-could-be-better-you): This Oxford article argues that working out with friends lessens fatigue and increases enjoyment and that this heightened positive effect can lead to better performance.  
  * [Running clubs are gaining traction across the world](https://www.acefitness.org/resources/pros/expert-articles/8869/the-power-of-running-clubs-community-connection-and-consistency/?srsltid=AfmBOor8Q7378AsMcTPDcmugvW6HbET0zj2aQfrRztEsEK8WDJr94Xz9) as people seek a solution to loneliness and social isolation: An Ace health and fitness instructor writes about the many benefits of joining a running club such as encouragement, increased security, and a sense of community, as well as discussing how readers can find one in their area.  
  * [Joining a club can only enhance](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/may/08/join-running-club-or-run-alone) the experience of being a runner: This article describes the many ways clubs can support runners at any level, emphasizing running clubs as an option in addition to solo running.   
## Comparables  
  * [**Strava**](https://www.strava.com/): Strava is a popular app for runners, its “Community-Powered Motivation” helps many stay engaged. However, it primarily attracts experienced runners and looks less beginner friendly, especially after they appeared to recently change around their training plan feature. While it helps users find new routes, it does not have as much of a focus on matching users with running partners or groups, which limits its usefulness for those seeking social connections or group motivation.  
  * [**Nike Run Club**](https://www.nike.com/nrc-app): Nike Run Club offers guided runs, tracking, and a social feed but it appears that its social features are mostly for sharing achievements rather than matching users with partners or groups. The developers of Nike Run Club have also changed the application's name twice before, which indicates the app may still have an unclear identity and could change again, especially since starting out as Nike+ GPS indicates something different about what the app was intended to be.  
  * [**MyFitnessPal**](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/): MyFitnessPal offers tracking for various fitness activities, including running. It tackles the problem of tracking running and other fitness related activities but apart from sharing general encouragement and sharing progress in the social features it does have, it does not look at opportunities where users could do and bond over those activities together.  
  * [**Facebook Groups**](https://www.facebook.com/): Many local running groups use Facebook’s Groups feature to organize events and connect members. While this can be effective, it relies on users already being part of the right group and does not offer more specific matching, such as filtering groups by pace, location, or goals, which makes it not specific enough for what runners may be looking for.  
  * [**Meetup.com**](https://www.meetup.com/): This application allows users to find and join different groups, including local running groups. It is useful for discovering events, but these events appear to be for longer runs, such as 5 miles, which beginners would not necessarily want to participate in and are also planned farther out in advance. Our app would also emphasize spontaneity when it comes to making plans for running and allows for more personalization for the runs they go on based on who they match with.  
  * [**Couch to 5k**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.c25k&hl=en_US): This application is designed to help beginners start running with a specific goal in mind but it assumes users want to always train for a race and may add pressure, especially if a user may need to slow down their journey. It also does not focus on building social connections or group support, making running seem like an activity to do alone.  
  * [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/): The Running subreddit specifically on Reddit provides advice, support, and a community for runners, but is not location based and does not facilitate in-person connections or group formation. Similar to Facebook Groups and Meetup, Reddit has so many groups that it does not appear to offer specific filtering through messages and running groups.  
  * [**RunHub**](https://www.runhub.com/): RunHub acts as a directory for running clubs and events, which makes it useful for finding formal clubs but does not support the formation of informal, small running groups or partners, which can be seen with its application that requires extensive information before one can submit their club. They tackle the problem of human connection when running, but it may seem daunting and unwelcoming to beginners.  
  
## Features 

These features address user needs and align with our goal of solving the problem mentioned above. 

  * **Running clubs.** This feature would provide users with the ability to start their own running club by just requiring a form that would request information such as pace, location, and when they would typically have their runs, and the ability to join a group with minimal barriers to entry for either side. This feature also benefits an indirect stakeholder, grocery stores and athletic businesses, in the long term when these groups meet up to purchase any running related equipment they may need and if they order customized team merchandise.   
  * **Challenges.** By introducing the idea of challenges, it rewards and encourages the user to dedicate more time to running and to connecting with other users. An example challenge could be “reach 5 members in your run club.”  
  * **Leadership Boards.** A leadership board feature could be introduced that could tie in with the Challenges feature to add to the sense of motivation for runners. We would offer local and national leadership boards for statistics that relate to runners on an individual level and for statistics related to running clubs.   
  * **Partner Matching.** This feature would look at the one on one aspect of our idea, which would be matching users looking for a person to go on a run with by generating matches based on running experience level, location, gender, and other filtering features. Whether they continue to keep running together or run once, it encourages human connection and helps users stay active through running.  
  * **Safety.** Since we know that applications such as Facebook Groups or dating apps that can facilitate in-person meetings can carry risks, we have thought about different safety measures. This would include allowing location sharing (which could also be useful for tracking a running route) or an option where if a user has not checked in to the app to mark their run as complete within a certain amount of time that would depend on their run, the application may alert a trusted contact they provide.
