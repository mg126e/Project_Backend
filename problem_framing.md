# Problem Framing

* **Domain**: a description of the general domain you’re interested in.  
  * Running. Running is a popular activity that many users may find difficult to get into. Running allows users to improve their mental wellbeing and physical health  
* **Problem**: an outline of the problem your app will address.  
  * It is difficult to find organized running groups and break into the sport alone.  
* **Evidence**: evidence that the problem is real and experienced by others.  
  * [Having running partners](https://zapendurance.com/group-running-vs-running-alone/#:~:text=Joining%20a%20local%20running%20group,taxing%20both%20physically%20and%20mentally.) adds a level of accountability that is difficult to achieve otherwise.  
  *  [Increases over time](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8966768/) in the number of co-runners (of any ability level) are related to increases in the number of weekly running sessions…Our study demonstrates that social networks play an important role in maintaining a consistent training habit and in reaching set goals (i.e., participating in a race).  
  * [Members of the running group](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337690074_Running_together_is_better_than_running_alone_a_qualitative_study_of_a_self-organised_distance_running_group_in_China) had positive social interaction and support during and outside running. Additionally, some members formed friendships and small circles within the larger running group. Finally, members reported various positive impacts of the running group on their running, physical/mental health, personality, and attitude towards life.  
  * [Affective feelings are directly influenced by the presence of opponents](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32050163/) during an Head to Head race, and a more positive affective feeling could be involved in the dissociation between rating of perceived exertion and running speed and, consequently, the overall race performance.  
  * [How can moving together make us feel closer and more connected?](https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/article/why-exercising-friends-could-be-better-you) There are probably two related but distinct routes through which this happens. At the neurobiological level, we release endorphins and endocannabinoids during exercise; these chemical messengers make us feel happy and content, and they are responsible for the ‘runner’s high’.  
* **Comparables**: notes about existing solutions to the problem or related problems.  
  * Strava  
  * MyFitnessTracker  
  * Facebook groups, specifically the group feature  
  * [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com)  
  * Couch to 5k (makes assumption that user wants to do running with this goal)  
* **Features**: possible features to address the problem.  
  * Profile w/ running stats and history  
  * Matching w/ a person  
  * Ability to form a run club  
* **Ethical analysis**: an identification of stakeholders and the impacts they might experience.
