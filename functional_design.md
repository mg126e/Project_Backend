## User Journey

A recent college grad has moved to a new city. She is unsure of how to find a community since she does not have any friends closeby. She decides to take a look at her hobbies and recalls how she was interested in running but never could commit to it in college. She comes across our website, and upon registering, she personalizes her profile, including adding a photo of herself, information about herself, and information about what she is looking for in a running partner. She notes that a beginner challenge has showed up on her page, signalling to her that the goal is for her to meet with 1 new runner. 

She decides to start looking, heading over to the matching page and picks another runner from the generated matches she filtered based on gender and location who also does not have running experience. They exchange information and decide to go on a run. She has a great experience and with this user, she decides they should form a run club full of beginners. They create their club using a quick form on the website, and wait for others to join! The user is very satisfied with her experience and looks forward to continue meeting others, noticing how she can rise on the leadership board (decide which qualities), and working on new challenges.
